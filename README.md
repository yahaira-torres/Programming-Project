# Programming-Project

My group settled on a dataset about cybersecurity attacks that has 25 different columns. The columns show information such as, the type of attack, when the attack happened, the action that was taken in response to the attack, etc. We used the jupyter notebook to analyze the data with different commands and answer the questions below.

What Attack was the most common?

What Protocol was the most common?

What was the highest anomaly score?

Where most attacks Blocked, Logged, or Ignored?

To answer these questions, we imported matplotlib and pandas. Importing matplotlib allowed us to make graphs and give a visual representation of the data. Through our analysis we were able to answer the questions above, and gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. This project helped us expand our knowledge as cybersecurity majors. 

You can run the Jupyter notebook with matplotlib version 3.10.1 and pandas version 2.2.2 as shown in the requirements.txt file
