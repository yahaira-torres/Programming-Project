Question 1: What Protocol was the most common?
Question 2: What was the highest anomaly score?
Question 3: Where most attacks Blocked, Logged, or Ignored?
Question 4: What Attack was the most common?
            The data showed that 'DDoS' was the most common attack. We used the command df['Attack Type'].value_counts() to answer this question. The ['Attack Type'] allows us to access a specific column in the csv. The value_counts() counts how many times a value shows up. DDoS showed the highest count.
